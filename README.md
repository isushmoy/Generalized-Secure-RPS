# Generalized Secure Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project implements a **generalized and secure version** of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using **HMAC (SHA-256)** for cryptographic fairness. The game allows an arbitrary odd number of moves, ensuring the computer cannot cheat by providing a cryptographically secure key and HMAC before the player makes their choice.

## Features
- Supports **arbitrary odd-numbered moves** (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock, or more).
- Ensures **game fairness** using cryptographic HMACs (SHA-256).
- Displays a **help table** showing the results between all moves.
- Works from the **command line** using any custom set of moves.
  
## How It Works
1. The computer generates a **cryptographically secure key** and uses it to create an HMAC of its move.
2. The **HMAC** is displayed to the player before they choose their move.
3. The player selects their move from a menu.
4. The winner is determined based on the circular order of the moves.
5. After the game, the original key is revealed, so the player can verify that the computerâ€™s move was not changed.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Generalized-Secure-RPS.git
    cd Generalized-Secure-RPS
    ```
2. Run the following command to install the required package:
   ```
   npm install ascii-table
   ```
3. Run the game using Node.js:
    ```bash
    node game.js Rock Paper Scissors
    ```

   Or use any odd number of custom moves, for example:
    ```bash
    node game.js Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
    ```

## Usage
- The game takes an **odd number of moves** as command-line arguments.
- Use `0` to exit the game.
- Use `?` to display a **help table** showing which moves win or lose.
- After the game, the **key** is revealed to verify the computer's move.

## Example:
```bash
$ node game.js Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
HMAC: <hmac_value>
Available moves:
1 - Rock
2 - Paper
3 - Scissors
4 - Lizard
5 - Spock
0 - Exit
? - Help
Enter your move: 2
Your move: Paper
Computer's move: Scissors
Computer Wins
HMAC Key: <key_value>
```
